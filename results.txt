**üìà Stock Price Info for AAPL:**
‚Ä¢ 30-day average: 201.96
‚Ä¢ Last closed price: 213.55

**üì∞ Market Sentiment Analysis for AAPL:**
‚Ä¢ **Market Sentiment: ‚ùå Negative**
‚Ä¢ The overall sentiment is negative due to disappointment and criticism towards Apple's WWDC 2025 updates, lack of impressive AI upgrades, and unimpressive products and features.

**üí∞ Financial Analysis for AAPL:**
‚Ä¢ **Financial Overview:**
	+ Strong cash flow metrics, with a significant free cash flow and operating cash flow.
	+ High profit margins, gross margin, and return on equity (ROE) and assets (ROA).
	+ Moderate revenue and earnings growth.
	+ High market capitalization and P/E ratio.
	+ Dividend yield and payout ratio are relatively low.

**‚≠ê Final Verdict:**
Based on the analysis, I would give AAPL an investment attractiveness score of 70 out of 100.

**Positives:**
‚úÖ Strong financials, with high cash flow, profit margins, and returns on equity and assets.
‚úÖ Moderate revenue and earnings growth.
‚úÖ High market capitalization and P/E ratio, indicating a stable and established company.

**Final Verdict**:
Based on the analysis, I would give SHOP an investment attractiveness score of 80 out of 100. The stock's recent uptrend, strong revenue growth, and high profit margins are positives. However, the high P/E Ratio and debt to equity ratio are risks to consider. The overall market sentiment is positive, with a strong bullish argument presented. The analyst rating is also a buy, which adds to the stock's attractiveness. Overall, I would recommend a buy, but with caution due to the potential regulatory issues and high valuation. ‚úÖ
