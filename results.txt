• 30-day average: 201.96
• Last closed price: 213.55

**📰 Market Sentiment Analysis for AAPL:**
• **Market Sentiment: ❌ Negative**
• The overall sentiment is negative due to disappointment and criticism towards Apple's WWDC 2025 updates, lack of impressive AI upgrades, and unimpressive products and features.

**💰 Financial Analysis for AAPL:**
• **Financial Overview:**
	+ Strong cash flow metrics, with a significant free cash flow and operating cash flow.
	+ High profit margins, gross margin, and return on equity (ROE) and assets (ROA).

However, the lack of transparency in cash flow metrics and high debt-to-equity ratio are risks that need to be considered. The neutral sentiment and strong buy recommendation from analysts also support the investment case. Overall, BAJFINANCE.NS appears to be a relatively attractive investment opportunity, but investors should exercise caution due to the high P/E ratio and debt levels.
